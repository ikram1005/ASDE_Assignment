Task-3 (debugging)

Given below is a Bash / Python script that performs following computation on an integer input (n):
If n is less than 10: Calculate its Square
Example: 4 => 16
If n is between 10 and 20: Calculate the factorial of (n-10)
Example: 15 => 120
If n is greater than 20: Calculate the sum of all integers between 1 and (n-20)
Example: 25 => 15

The task is to identify the bugs in the script, fix them and share the new script. Only one of the two scripts required Bash or Python. Hint: You can correct the script by only changing 3-4 characters.

//given code
def compute(n):
    if n < 10:
        out = n ** 2
    elif n < 20:
        out = 1
        for i in range(1, n-10):
            out *= i
    else:
        lim = n - 20
        out = lim * lim
        out = out - lim
        out = out / 2 
    print(out)


n = int(input("Enter an integer: "))
compute(n)



//Corrected code
def compute(n):
    if n < 10:
        out = n ** 2
    elif n < 20:
        out = 1
        for i in range(1, n-9):  
            out *= i
    else:
        lim = n - 20
        out = (lim * (lim + 1)) // 2  
    print(out)


n = int(input("Enter an integer: "))
compute(n)


//problems in given code as shown below:-

//1.In the factorial calculation block, the range should be changed from (n-10) to (n-9) because if n is 15, then (n - 9) is 6. The loop will iterate from 1 to 5 or if you not change then (n-10) is 5. the Loop will iterate from  to 4.
 
//2.In the sum calculation block, the formula has been corrected to calculate the sum of integers from 1 to (n-20).
//3.The // operator is used instead of / to perform integer division when calculating the sum.
